# What does it do?
If you use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) but do not want to be forced to use css animations for your components but want to use awesome [GSAP timelines](https://greensock.com/) instead? This module adds this functionality to your component!


# How does it do it?
This module uses the [transition-controller](https://github.com/larsvanbraam/transition-controller) module to create transition controllers for al your Vue.js components. It allows you to create super complex timelines for your pages and/or components. It even allows you to create multiple timelines per component and trigger the timeline that you need! To read more about this functionality please see the documentation for the transition-controller module!
